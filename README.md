Vehicle Management System
This project aims to manage vehicles along with their drivers and vehicle details in order to streamline processes. This becomes a platform to have oneâ€™s vehicle all in one place. 
The vehicles will be registered with their details and owner details. This would allow vehicle to be identified and their details to be readily available for authorised persons for different uses. 

The project requires making use of the GUI features offered by Java as well as Java EE technologies such as JSPs, Servlets, Session Management, etc. It mainly requires relational database connectivity to MySQL using JDBC. It also involves setting up Enterprise beans along with CSS for styling the web application.

Will be uploading the code slowly but surely since I am caught up in exams atm!
